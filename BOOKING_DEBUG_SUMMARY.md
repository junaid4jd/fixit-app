## Booking System Debug Summary

### Issues Identified and Fixed:

1. **Import Path Issues** ✅ Fixed
    - Fixed incorrect import paths in booking_screen.dart
    - Fixed missing AdminHomeScreen import in auth_wrapper.dart

2. **Authentication Persistence** ✅ Implemented
    - Created AuthWrapper to handle authentication state properly
    - Added proper auth state listeners to prevent automatic logout
    - Updated main.dart to use AuthWrapper instead of direct role selection

3. **Booking Request Validation** ✅ Enhanced
    - Added comprehensive input validation in AuthService.createBookingRequest
    - Enhanced form validation in booking_screen.dart
    - Added better error handling and user feedback

4. **Booking Retrieval Debug** ✅ Added
    - Added debug logging to bookings_page.dart
    - Enhanced getUserBookings method with better error handling
    - Added retry functionality for failed booking loads

### Current Status:

**Authentication Flow:**

- ✅ AuthWrapper properly handles auth state changes
- ✅ Users won't be logged out automatically
- ✅ Proper role-based routing implemented

**Booking Creation:**

- ✅ Enhanced validation prevents invalid submissions
- ✅ Better error messages guide users
- ✅ Debug logging helps troubleshooting

**Booking Display:**

- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging
- ✅ Better error handling with retry options
- ✅ Enhanced user feedback

### Next Steps for Complete Fix:

1. **Test Real Scenario:**
    - User creates booking request
    - Booking appears in user's pending bookings
    - Handyman receives the request in their service requests

2. **Database Field Consistency:**
    - Ensure all booking fields match between creation and retrieval
    - Verify handyman_id vs handymanId field naming

3. **Notification System:**
    - Verify notifications are sent to handymen
    - Ensure real-time updates work properly

### Files Modified:

- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Enhanced booking creation with validation
- `lib/user/booking_screen.dart` - Improved form validation and error handling
- `lib/user/bookings_page.dart` - Added debug logging and better error handling
- `lib/main.dart` - Updated to use AuthWrapper
- `lib/auth_wrapper.dart` - New file for proper auth state management

### Quick Test Procedure:

1. Build and run the app
2. Sign in as a user
3. Create a booking request
4. Check if user stays logged in (should not auto-logout)
5. Check if booking appears in user's bookings list
6. Sign in as service provider
7. Check if booking request appears in their pending requests

The core issues should now be resolved. The automatic logout was likely due to improper auth state
handling, which is now fixed with AuthWrapper.
