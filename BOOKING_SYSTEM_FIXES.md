# Booking System Fixes - User Side

## Overview

Fixed several critical issues in the user-side booking request system to ensure smooth booking
creation, validation, and error handling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Booking Request Creation (AuthService)

**Problem**: Insufficient validation and error handling in `createBookingRequest`
**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive input validation
- Enhanced error messages and logging
- Added proper null checks for user and handyman existence
- Improved data structure consistency

**Changes Made**:

- Validate required fields (description, address, phone)
- Add debug logging for troubleshooting
- Ensure proper data trimming and sanitization
- Add `is_reviewed` field for tracking review status

### 2. Booking Screen Form Validation

**Problem**: Weak form validation allowing invalid submissions
**Solution**:

- Enhanced service description validation (minimum 10 characters)
- Improved phone number validation with regex
- Added date/time validation
- Better handyman ID validation

**Changes Made**:

- Stricter validation rules for all form fields
- More descriptive error messages
- Date selection validation to prevent past dates

### 3. Error Handling and User Feedback

**Problem**: Generic error messages providing poor user experience
**Solution**:

- Parse specific error types and show appropriate messages
- Add retry functionality with SnackBar actions
- Better loading states and user feedback

**Changes Made**:

- Context-aware error messages
- Retry functionality for failed submissions
- Enhanced loading indicators

### 4. Import Path Fixes

**Problem**: Incorrect import paths causing compilation issues
**Solution**:

- Fixed relative import paths
- Ensured proper module organization
