## Category Display Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

The issue where admin-added categories are not showing up on the user side can be caused by several
factors. Here are the fixes implemented and steps to resolve:

### 1. Firestore Security Rules Issue (Most Likely Cause)

The default Firestore rules might be blocking read access to the `categories` collection for
non-admin users.

**Solution**: Update Firestore rules to allow read access to categories:

```javascript
// Add this to your Firestore Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to categories for all authenticated users
    match /categories/{categoryId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Allow read access to cities for all authenticated users
    match /cities/{cityId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Other rules...
  }
}
```

### 2. Missing Firestore Index

The compound query (filtering by `isActive` and ordering by `order`) requires a composite index.

**Solution**:

1. Check the Firebase Console > Firestore > Indexes
2. Create a composite index for the `categories` collection:
    - Field 1: `isActive` (Ascending)
    - Field 2: `order` (Ascending)

### 3. Improved Error Handling

Added better logging and fallback mechanisms in the code:

- Enhanced error logging in `AuthService.getCategories()`
- Added fallback query that doesn't rely on compound indexes
- Improved user feedback in the UI
- Added direct Firestore connection test for debugging

### 4. Network/Connection Issues

If the above doesn't work, check:

- Internet connectivity
- Firebase project configuration
- Firebase initialization

### Testing

Run the app and check the console output for:

- "Loaded X categories" messages
- "Direct query returned X documents" messages
- Any error messages from Firestore

### Quick Fix Steps:

1. Update Firestore Security Rules (most important)
2. Create the required index in Firebase Console
3. Restart the app to test the fixes
4. Check console logs for detailed error information

The code now includes comprehensive error handling and will provide detailed logging to help
identify the exact issue.
